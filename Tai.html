		<p> Tai has changed my view on what I want to do with my life after I graduate. Before his YouTube ads, I considered something such as game design. Now I want to go into entrepneurship and hopefully open my own business one day. He showed me that you can escape the typical 9-5 job and enjoy what you do. Business shows me that there is a sort of freedom that comes with it. Although it is more difficult, the rewards are that much better when you overcome the obstacles. </p>
		<p> Tai inspires me to do more than what is expected of me. He makes me think about ways to help those around me and make this area a better place. He makes me strive to learn more about the world and read more books than what is required in school. He doesn't lie when he says that it won't be easy, and that I will have to work at improving myself both inside and out if I want to be very successful and to make a change in the world. </p>
