		<p> This is my final exam website for 5th period. This is a list of people that have inspired me in one way or another. They have affected me and helped make me become who I am today. I hold these people in the highest regard for their individual contributions to society. In this article I will list their accomplishments and successes in life. </p>

	<article style="float: right; margin-right: 50px">
		<p> In this article I will explain in further detail as to why I think these people are inspirational and role models to me. Again, they have helped me become who I am now and I will explain what they have inspired me to become. </p>
		<p> These people are both a serious and funny choice for my people of inspiration. I chose Gandhi because he is a major person in terms of equality, but also because he is a typical choice for people to pick. I chose Dave because even though he can be controversial at times, he is a good guy and sticks up for himself and those around him. I chose Joe because he is one of my closest and funniest friends, but also because he has done a lot for many students in our area. I chose Tai because he is the reason I am interested in business, but also because he gets to hang out with celebrities and travel the world. Finally, i chose Mr. Rose because he's too cool to be left out. </p>
