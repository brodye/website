		<p> Jason Rose is the first teacher that I have had at the ATC, and he will always be my favorite. He makes my days better because he doesn't care to call people out. Everyday he tells jokes and drinks his Rehab or Arizona tea. He calls out people for not doing their work and tells us to do what we set our mind to. Although he can be savage, he puts a lot of pride into his job as my teacher. </p>
		<p> He pushes me because he sees the potential in me that I sometimes don't. He is a major reason why I want to do something in the IT department after I graduate because he makes it so interesting and fun. He helped me get certified because he's cool like that. He can brutally honest about things and it shows me that he cares for his students. He wants us all to succeed and he takes his job very serious. </p>
